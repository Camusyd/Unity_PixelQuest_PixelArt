# PixelQuest 🎮  

PixelQuest is my first Unity 2D game project.  
It’s a simple platformer where the player can move, jump, and interact with basic animations.  
The goal of this project is to learn the fundamentals of Unity, including **Animator Controllers, Animations, Scripts, and GitHub version control**.  

## ✨ Features
- Basic 2D movement (left, right, jump).  
- Animator Controller with different states (Idle, Walk, Jump).  
- Simple environment with platforms and colliders.  
- Organized Unity project ready to expand with new mechanics.  

## 🛠️ Built With
- [Unity](https://unity.com/) – Game engine.  
- [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) – Scripting language.  
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) – Version control.
